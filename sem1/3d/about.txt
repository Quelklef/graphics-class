If a function returns a result, it may do so in one of two ways:
  - Using the return statement
  - Modifying one or more passed-in 'result' variable
If the second method is used, the function MUST be suffixed with '_M'.
Additionally, the passed-in result variables(s) MUST be the leftmost
parameters and SHOULD either be named 'result' or begin with 'result_'.
